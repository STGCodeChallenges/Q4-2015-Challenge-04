I have written this program in Java.  I am also writing it in a very compressed amount of time, so it is going to be extremely basic.  
  1. To begin with, there is no user input.  All data is pre-entered in Arrays.  If you wish to change the score data, you must change it in the application.  Eventually I'll break it out into some sort of parser or user-entry interface.  For the purposes of this program, it will be sufficient.
  2. Second, there is no concept of multiple players being entered.  A single player is scored... no more.
  3. Third, I've also left all of the code in the default package, and simplified structure complexity.

This program should meet the requirements of this coding challenge.  To run, you will need to build the project.
You can run it through an IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.  Or you can run it directly from the command prompt.

NOTE:  I am using the old graphic characters from ASCII DOS, and they may not work on all non-Microsoft platforms.
I would expect that neithe neither Linux nor Mac OS has any awareness of this character set.  Recommended to run within Windows.
